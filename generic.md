More than 1 million Chilean people protested in Santiago, the capital of Chile, to demand higher wages, more jobs, better living conditions, and removal of cabinet members. I am working as a data scientist at the UN to provide data solutions to present the labor market dynamics to all the labor ministers of Latin America and Caribean countries and assisting economists in designing better labor policies for sustainable economic developments.

Digital job networks have given businesses and workers the flexibility and the opportunity to offer services through the specification of particular skills. Few understood their role and what they can reveal about today's labor market dynamics in Latin America. At the UN, I research to create data science solutions from data collection to cleaning to visualization to help study the labor markets in the 33 LAC countries.

The United Nations and governments in LAC countries don't have time-series data for labor market dynamics, and the presidents and economic affairs officer want to learn more about the labor market while catching up with the big data transformation. To address the lack of data, I implement web scrapers to gather millions of job postings and talent profiles from 9 online job sites daily, weekly, or monthly based on the scale of demand. I collect the demanded skills, education level, experience, contract type, salary, and other labor-related data per city, per country, and per sector. Then, we draw on a variety of complementary sources from the international, pan-regional, and national levels to analyze freelancing, full-time, and part-time markets. This is an ongoing research project, and I am motivated to use data science to facilitate regional labor policy change with the UN.
