More than 1 million Chilean people protested in Santiago, the capital of Chile, to demand higher wages, more jobs, better living conditions, and removal of cabinet members. I am working as a data scientist at the UN to provide data solutions to present the labor market dynamics to the labor ministers of Latin America and Caribean countries and assisting economists in designing better labor policies for sustainable economic developments.

Big data transformation certainly changed the way how traditional research is done in economics. Following the research of University of Oxford, the OLI(Online Labor Index)[https://ilabour.oii.ox.ac.uk/online-labour-index/], the Economic Comission of Latin America and the Caribbean wants to create Online Labor Market Data Observatory to study the labor market dynamics in the Latin America and the Caribbean resgions. To address the lack of data, I implement web scrapers to gather millions of job postings and talent profiles from 9 online job sites daily, weekly, or monthly based on the scale of demand. 

The original research of the Universit yof Oxford only covers the Alexa ranked popular freelancing websites. After researching, I chose to approach the problem across 33 countries temporally and in 2 types of labor market with both demand and supply covered: global freelancing market and domestic local market. To address both the global freelancing market and the domestic labor market. I collect the demanded skills, education level, experience, contract type, salary, local information, and other labor-related data per city, per country, and per sector on both freelancing platforms and on several local based online job networks. I work with economists to draw on a variety of complementary sources from the international, pan-regional, and national levels to analyze freelancing, full-time, and part-time markets. I am in the process of standardizing the data preprocessing procedures and also creating the dashboards for visualizations. This is an ongoing research project, and I am motivated to use data science to facilitate regional evidence-based labor policy change with the United Nations.
