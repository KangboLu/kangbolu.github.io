My name is Kangbo Lu. I am a data scientist and a music producer.

Currently, I am pursuing my master of data science degree at the University of British Columbia at Canada. My estimated graduation will be around late June in 2021. I have a Mathematics associate degree and a Computer Science associate degree from Diablo Valley College. Later, I finished my Computer Science bachelor degree requirement in less than 2 years after transfer to University of California, Davis. I have also worked as a research assistant for 6 months under the supervision of [Martin Hilbert](https://communication.ucdavis.edu/people/hilbert), who created and coordinated the [Information Society Programme](http://www.cepal.org/SocInfo) of the United Nations Regional Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. In his 15 years as United Nations Economic Affairs Officer he performed hands-on technical assistance in the field of digital development to presidents, government experts, legislators, diplomats, NGOs, and companies in more than 20 countries.

I have 2 years of data science experience. Working as a data scientist at the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe), I used my web scrapping skills to collect labor market data from freelancing and tranditional labor markets online temporally. The labor market project lasted 1 year and I created the first Online Labor Market Index of Latin America and Caribbean to track the labor market dynamics of 33 countries LAC region. We studied the online freelancing labor market and the local full-time and part-time labor market for 33 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.

In the past 2 years of working in the data science field, I have acquired skills in web scrapping (Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium), data preprocessing (Regex, Pandas, Tidyverse, NLTK, SQL), data visualization (Plotly, ggplot, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Altair, Dash, Shiny, Tableau), statistical data analysis (infer, JAGS, regression and clustering analysis), data modeling (Sklearn, PyTorch, and various packages in R), and report writing. Two of my research works are published at the United Nations library and I have attended the Third Statistical Conference at Chile.

I have been playing music for 15 years. I can perform, compose, arrange, produce, mix, and master musical works. The genres that I have produced are Lofi Hiphop, Piano instrumental, Guitar Instrumental, Future House, Progressive House, Techno, Minimal Techno, and Percussive Fingerstyle. I am continuing expanding my knowledge of production and composition to make music. I have verified artist account under Caxias Lu with 13 singles including 2 EPs published on Apple Music, Spotify, Youtube Music, Amazon Music, and other music platforms.
